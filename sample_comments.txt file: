think the new fare system is fair, it makes sense to pay based on distance.
I don't like the new fare system. It is confusing and unfair.
The distance-based fare system is a good idea, it will help people save money.
I believe this new fare system is not fair to people living in distant areas.
It's hard to understand the new system, and it's making me frustrated.
